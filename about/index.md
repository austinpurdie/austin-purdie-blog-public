I use this space to blog about machine learning, math, and coding. I'm so happy you're here! To be honest, this website is more for me than anyone else. To build expertise, reading about an algorithm is well enough... but writing an article with the intent of teaching someone else is even better!

I'm currently working as a quantitative modeler at a regional bank in Salt Lake.

Academically, my interests center around machine learning, optimization, probability, and statistics. I love these subjects because they are the best tools we have to predict the future which is pretty neat! I earned a master's degree in statistics in 2023 and a bachelor's degree in mathematics and statistics in 2021, both from the University of Utah.

Outside of my work, I love to cook and bake, spend time with friends and family, and spoil my two cats, Carl and Pearline. I can make a mean cappucino and I have a knack for growing exotic tropical plants. I play the piano decently and bike around the city when I have the chance!

Again, thanks so much for being here. If you'd like to connect, simply follow the social links at the top of this page!
